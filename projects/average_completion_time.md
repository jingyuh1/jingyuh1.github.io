Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the average completion time. Each task must run nonpreemptively, that is, once task ai starts, it
must run continuously for pi units of time until it is done.

I have been playing League of Legends since S4. I had just graduated from elementary school at that time. For me at that time, this kind of MOBA game was the whole world. It subverted my understanding of the game. After playing it for two years, I gradually became proficient. Suddenly there was news in our city that a League of Legends campus competition was going to be held. After seeing the news, I immediately contacted my classmates to form a team. The next story is that our team of five won the championship.
