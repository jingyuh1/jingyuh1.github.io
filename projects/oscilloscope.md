"League of Legends" is a hero battle MOBA competitive online game developed by Riot Games in the United States and operated by Tencent Games in mainland China. There are hundreds of individual heroes in the game, as well as unique systems such as a ranking system and a rune system. "League of Legends" is committed to promoting the development of global e-sports. In addition to linking various divisions to develop professional leagues and create an e-sports system, it has also held campus events.

I have been playing League of Legends since S4. I had just graduated from elementary school at that time. For me at that time, this kind of MOBA game was the whole world. It subverted my understanding of the game. After playing it for two years, I gradually became proficient. Suddenly there was news in our city that a League of Legends campus competition was going to be held. After seeing the news, I immediately contacted my classmates to form a team. The next story is that our team of five won the championship.
