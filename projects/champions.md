"League of Legends" is a hero battle MOBA competitive online game developed by Riot Games in the United States and operated by Tencent Games in mainland China. There are hundreds of individual heroes in the game, as well as unique systems such as a ranking system and a rune system. "League of Legends" is committed to promoting the development of global e-sports. In addition to linking various divisions to develop professional leagues and create an e-sports system, it has also held campus events.

For this project, I was the lead programmer who was responsible for programming the various capabilities of the mouse.  I started by programming the basics, such as sensor polling and motor actuation using interrupts.  From there, I then programmed the basic PD controls for the motors of the mouse.  The PD control the drive so that the mouse would stay centered while traversing the maze and keep the mouse driving straight.  I also programmed basic algorithms used to solve the maze such as a right wall hugger and a left wall hugger algorithm.  From there I worked on a flood-fill algorithm to help the mouse track where it is in the maze, and to map the route it takes.  We finished with the fastest mouse who finished the maze within our college.
