## Overview
The problem: In an era where schools must carefully manage limited resources, store bidding has become an essential process. Store bidding allows schools to procure materials, supplies, and services through a competitive process that encourages vendors to submit proposals. This method not only ensures cost savings but also provides multiple benefits, including transparency, quality assurance, and efficient use of funds. By understanding the importance of store bidding, schools can make better financial and operational decisions that ultimately benefit students, staff, and the community.

The solution:  The Store bidding is an application for Businessmen or schools can share information and appeals with each other.

## Approch
The Store bidding is an application for Businessmen or schools can share information and appeals with each other.

## Approch
* Buyers and sellers don't have to be UH students, faculty, or staff. 
* There is no anonymity: buyers and sellers connect through their UH credentials.
Alerts: Users can set up alerts, for example if they are looking for a sofa, or a particular textbook, or whatever. Then they are automatically notified when that item is listed for sale.

Photos: The system must support photos. Initially, images can be specified as URLs, but the final version should support uploading of photos.

Complaints: Users can mark content or other users as inappropriate. The admins must resolve these issues and ban users who violate the Terms of Use.

Quality Assurance :Bidding also ensures that schools can select vendors based on the quality of products and services, not just the lowest price. A thorough bidding process allows schools to review the reputation, reliability, and standards of each vendor. By doing so, they can ensure that purchased items, from classroom supplies to cafeteria food, meet the necessary safety and quality standards, providing a secure and high-standard environment for students.

Some possible mockup pages include:

* Landing page
* User home page
* Admin home page
* User Profile page
* Categories page
* Category page
* List Item page
* Create item page
* Make offer on item page
* Notify admin page

## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for item, sets up notification.
* User logs in, lists item to sell.
* User tries to buy item.
* User and admin interact to ban inappropriate usage.

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

A rating system for buyers and sellers.
Map-based interface to indicate where goods are.
