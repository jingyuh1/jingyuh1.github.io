## Overview
The problem: In an era where schools must carefully manage limited resources, store bidding has become an essential process. Store bidding allows schools to procure materials, supplies, and services through a competitive process that encourages vendors to submit proposals. This method not only ensures cost savings but also provides multiple benefits, including transparency, quality assurance, and efficient use of funds. By understanding the importance of store bidding, schools can make better financial and operational decisions that ultimately benefit students, staff, and the community.

The solution:  The Store bidding is an application for Businessmen or schools can share information and appeals with each other.

## Approch
The Store bidding is an application for Businessmen or schools can share information and appeals with each other.

## Approch
* Buyers and sellers don't have to be UH students, faculty, or staff. 
* There is no anonymity: buyers and sellers connect through their UH credentials.
Transactions are expected to occur on-campus. If a seller wants to meet off-campus, that can be a red-flag.
Because buyers and sellers are from UHM, the goods and services will be relevant to UH students.
