With the rapid development of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated into every aspect of modern life. From daily entertainment, work to study, AI is changing the world in a way that cannot be ignored. Especially for students majoring in computer science, the popularization of AI not only provides convenience, but also brings huge learning and development opportunities. However, the impact of AI is not limited to technology and efficiency, it also changes the way people think. Taking education as an example, the application of AI technology provides new possibilities for learning. For example, intelligent learning platforms analyze students' learning habits and customize personalized learning plans for them. This method of teaching students in accordance with their aptitude allows students to learn knowledge more efficiently.

## In-class Practice and WODs In-class WODs

I will occasionally use AI when writing WODs. When writing VS code, some errors will be prompted. Some VS code programs can be modified by oneself, and some errors can only be found and fixed by oneself. When I browse all the codes and don't find any obvious errors but still get prompts, I will ask my questions to AI to help me.

## Essays

When I encounter writing bottlenecks, AI can help organize ideas or generate topics through dialogue with users. For example: Brainstorming: AI can list related topics, subtopics, or ask questions to trigger students' thinking. For example, "How does artificial intelligence affect life?" can be broken down into specific fields such as education, medical care, and transportation. Structural suggestions: AI can help me design the general framework of the article, such as the layout of the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

## Final project

When completing the final project, I tried my best to use the knowledge I learned in ICS314 to complete the task myself. But sometimes difficulties are difficult to solve on your own. Therefore, if errors occur when writing code, I will ask chatgpt how to modify and improve it. Locating errors: Students can input error information into AI, and AI will explain the cause of the error and suggest solutions. For example: "SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing" can be interpreted as the code is missing closing brackets or is indented incorrectly.

## Learning a concept / tutorial

AI can design customized tutorials and projects to meet students' interests. For example, a student interested in web development could have AI help generate a tutorial from scratch, step-by-step through HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, and complete a blogging website project in the process. This personalized approach to learning not only increases student engagement but also allows them to apply what they learn into real-world applications. AI also plays an important role in solving problems. Students will inevitably encounter errors or logic loopholes when coding. At this time, AI can quickly diagnose the cause of the error and explain it in a simple and easy-to-understand way. For example, for errors such as "SyntaxError: unexpected indent", AI will remind students to check the indentation of the code. In addition, AI can also review students' code, point out inefficient implementation methods, and suggest more elegant code logic, allowing students to gradually improve code quality while learning.

# Explaining code and Writing code

There are always many ways to complete programming code. For example, there are many ways to achieve the same goal when designing an HTML page. Some I learned from videos and some I saw on other websites. Some codes I don't understand at all why they are written this way. In situations like this I would ask the AI, what are the benefits and basic logic questions of the way other codes are programmed.

## Conclusion

AI is profoundly affecting modern life and bringing unprecedented opportunities to computer science students. By making good use of AI tools, students can improve learning efficiency, enhance practical abilities, and open up space for career development. However, while utilizing AI, students should also maintain independent thinking skills and pay attention to the ethical issues of technology. In the future, the development of AI will further promote the progress of human society, and computer science students, as important promoters of this change, should continue to explore in learning and practice, and actively participate in the innovation and application of AI.
