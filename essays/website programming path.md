Software engineering is a discipline that studies the use of engineering methods to build and maintain effective, practical and high-quality software. Whether software development is a science or an engineering project is a question that has been debated for a long time. In fact, software development has characteristics of both. But that doesn't mean they can be confused with each other. Many people think that software engineering is based on computer science and information science in the same way that engineering is based on physics and chemistry in the traditional sense. It involves programming languages, databases, and software development tools. From the perspective of software development, it is a set of development activities that use appropriate resources (including personnel, software and hardware resources, time, etc.) to develop software. At the end of the activity When input (that is, user needs) is transformed into output (software products that ultimately meet user needs). 


In addition to studying common basic courses, this major will also systematically study courses such as discrete mathematics, data structure, algorithm analysis, object-oriented programming, modern operating systems, database principles and implementation technologies, compilation principles, software engineering, software project management, computer security, etc. . 


Web development includes two major job divisions: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development mainly uses Html, CSS and JavaScript, while back-end development can use languages ​​such as Java, Python, PHP, and C#. I am also very interested in mobile terminal development. With the development of the mobile Internet, many graduates currently focus on the development of mobile apps, mainly including iOS terminal development and Android terminal development. With the implementation of 5G standards, the development scenarios of mobile terminals will be further expanded in the future, such as in-depth integration with the Internet of Things.
